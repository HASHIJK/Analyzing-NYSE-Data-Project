For the final project, I conducted three Tasks:
    1. Complete my own data analysis and create a presentation to share your findings,
    2. Develop a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement.
    3. Create a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios.
Each of them has a detail, as following:

In this task, I framed three questions, and analyzing the data to get answers about them. These questions included quantitative variables such as [financial metrics] and qualitative variables such as [GICS Sector or GICS Sub Industry]. I used a descriptive analysis of these questions, like [calculating means, std, quartiles, etc.]. And using these metrics to extracting the insights and interpreting them from a financial perspective.
