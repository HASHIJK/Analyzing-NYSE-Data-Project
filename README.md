**Project Description** <br/>
This is a final project of the Introduction to data Course, which is one of the Business Analytics' Courses. In this project, you must to prepare and analyze the data, and sharing the findings as a presentation that explaining the most important insights. I spend 5 almost 5 days in this project, it was useful and challenging.
<br/>
**Getting Dataset** <br/>
You can get the entire dataset via Kaggle platform. In this project I used the fundamentals.csv file as a smaller subset of the data.
<br/>
**Project Requirements** <br/>
For the final project, I conducted three Tasks: <br/>
    1. Complete my own data analysis and create a presentation to share your findings. <br/>
    2. Develop a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement. <br/>
    3. Create a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios. <br/>
Each of them has a detail, as following: <br/>
<br/>
**Task 1 Details** <br/>
In this task, I framed three questions, and analyzing the data to get answers about them. These questions included quantitative variables such as [financial metrics] and qualitative variables such as [GICS Sector or GICS Sub Industry]. I used a descriptive analysis of these questions, like [calculating means, std, quartiles, etc.]. And using these metrics to extracting the insights and interpreting them from a financial perspective.
<br/>
**Task 2 Details** <br/>
This task is more advanced than the last, here I build a Dynamic P&L Statement that shows all the financial years for each a company and which the GICS Sectoer and the Sub Industry is located. The outcomes of this task are [drop-down list that shows the 500 companies] and the P&L metrics like [Total Revenue, COGS, Gross Profit, etc.]**.
<br/>
**Task 3 Details** <br/>
In this last task, I created a financial model for all the company, that forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case, and Base case). This financail model was dynamic, so it will change for every company and every scenario case. I used offset, index, match and lookup functions to do this dynamic model. And I uesd the moving averages mothed to forcast the next two years for each company. <br/>

That is all for now.
